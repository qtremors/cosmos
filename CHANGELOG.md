## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-14

### Added

#### 🪐 Pluto & Charon
- **Pluto** dwarf planet with inclined orbit (oscillates above/below ecliptic)
- **Charon** moon with orbit path visualization
- Added to radar menu and lock-on system

#### 🎯 Orbital Camera Control
- Orbit around locked targets using mouse drag, arrow keys, or gamepad
- Spherical coordinate system for smooth orbital movement
- Preserves lock while changing viewing angle

#### 📊 Stats HUD
- Top-right display panel with transparent blur styling
- **Free Flight:** Shows camera speed in km/s
- **Locked Mode:** Shows orbital speed (km/s) and distance from Sun (M km)

#### 🛸 Moon Orbit Paths
- Visual orbit rings for Moon, Europa, Titan, and Charon
- Subtle transparent lines around parent planets

#### 📡 Radar Menu Overhaul
- Organized into categories: Star, Planets, Moons, Other
- Colored dots for each entity
- Scrollable with custom scrollbar
- Asteroid Belt now lockable

### Changed
- Extracted `InputHandler.ts` module from App.tsx (~120 lines)
- Improved camera lock stability (position lerp + instant lookAt)

### Fixed
- Radar DOM refs preserved when HUD toggled off/on
- Labels toggle now works correctly (ref instead of closure)

## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-14

### 🎉 Initial Release

**Cosmos** is a modular, high-performance 3D solar system simulation built with React 19, Three.js, and TypeScript.

### Added

#### 🌍 Complete Solar System
- **Sun** with procedural granulation, corona, and adaptive glare shaders
- **8 Planets**: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune
- **3 Moons**: Moon (Earth), Europa (Jupiter), Titan (Saturn)
- **Asteroid Belt** with 4000 instanced asteroids
- **Background Starfield**

#### 🎨 Custom GLSL Shaders
- Procedural crater noise for Mercury
- Swirling cloud dynamics for Venus
- Land/ocean/cloud terrain generation for Earth
- Thin atmospheric glow for Mars
- Banded textures with Great Red Spot for Jupiter
- Procedural ring system for Saturn
- Ice giant storm dynamics for Uranus and Neptune

#### 🎮 Advanced Controls
- **6-DOF Fly Controls**: WASD movement, roll (Q/E), pitch/yaw (arrows)
- **Gamepad Support**: Full controller support with configurable deadzone
- **Camera Lock-On**: Click radar to follow any celestial body
- **Top-Down View**: Toggle satellite perspective with T key
- **Momentum Zoom**: Smooth inertia-based mouse wheel zooming

#### 🗺️ Navigation HUD
- **Radar Map**: Directionally-aware, rotates with camera heading
- **Smart Labels**: CSS2D labels that fade based on distance
- **Lock-On Menu**: Click radar to open planet selection list
- **Control Overlay**: Dynamic HUD with keyboard shortcuts

#### 🛠️ Cosmos SDK
- Centralized physics engine in `src/core/SDK.ts`
- Configurable constants for all planets (radius, distance, speed, color)
- Utility functions: `getOrbitalPosition()`, `getLabelOpacity()`, `smoothstep()`
- Full TypeScript interfaces for extensibility

#### 📦 Architecture
- Modular scene graph with each celestial body as a distinct class
- Shared GLSL noise functions in `src/materials/Noise.ts`
- Clean separation: `src/core/`, `src/objects/`, `src/materials/`
